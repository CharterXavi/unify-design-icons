### Welcome to the UNIFY Design Icon set by Charter Healthcare!

Currently, the icon set in this directory at /src/components is the current published NPM Package. The rest of this repo serves as a full Create React App app used to test the SVG Icons in development. 

Install the icon set in your project using NPM:

```npm i unify-design-icons```
